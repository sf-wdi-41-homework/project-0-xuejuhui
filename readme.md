# Racing Game
Create a racing game with two players each pressing one button and see who win the match.
## Installation
Everything was done on HTML Css and Js
### Rule 
Wait for the countdown and the player 1's key is Z, Player 2's key is X. When ever you win a match, your score will be record and click on reset to play again, but I dont see why since its boring.
